      An exploration from the fundamentals of computer science all the way up to implementing real time apps in just 8 lines of code. For most people, the latter would reek of assumption dependent frameworks, but we'll discover how to apply some primitive philosophies to escape from that pain and keep full control instead. Yes, you can have your cake and eat it too, with elegant and maintainable code - you'll laugh, you'll cry, we'll kill Socrates, and we'll cook a Kraken. Just don't bring popcorn, or it might burst the kernel into panic.
