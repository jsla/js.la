It can be difficult to write and deploy applications this way, but I've written some libraries such as dnode, upnode, seaport, and fleet to make this much easier to manage. In this talk I'll show how you can glue tiny processes together and split bigger ones up with these tools.",

With WebGL it was different - my first contact with this technology was through a client project. I had to learn WebGL on the go. It took me a few months to actually start apperciating it, but once the project was over and I thought I know everything about it, I decided to write my own engine that I baptized simply J3D. After a good start, I realized I didn't know that much about WebGL after all... Since then I spent many day & nights (mostly nights) learning and creating what I believe is a good tool for other developers to start creating 3D applications in the browser. In my presentation I talk about specific challenges when working WebGL projects and how J3D addresses them. I will also take you on a short walk-through of it's features and present some demos.",

No, there’s no new language to learn. Just familiar old HTML and JavaScript. As a matter of fact, there’s some stuff for you to un-learn. AngularJS is a client-side JavaScript web development framework where we believe we’ve done something special. We’ve approached the problem let’s say differently from the way any other JavaScript tool has before. Instead of asking what kind of functions we could provide to make writing apps smoother, we asked \"what if the browser worked differently in a way that eliminates code and gives structure to apps?\" This talk will take the audience on a tour of what the web platform of the future will look like and how the AngularJS framework can provide many of the powerful capabilities to existing browsers and bridge the path to web components, model driven views and other platform features that are currently being spec-ed.",

Static pages with responsive layouts aren't going to cut it in this new universe, so we'll look at using only JavaScript to structure applications, create and style markup, and also be platform aware in order to present users with an interactive experience suited for each device. This talk will be a general theory overview accompanied by plenty of examples and very brief code demonstrations. It will cover interesting points along the way such as best practices for smooth UI and animation, content management, SEO, and even how to use these exact techniques to create native mobile applications.",

I love the Open Source community in general, and the JavaScript community in general, and have been involved in the communities we lived before in Boston, Zurich and Berlin. I would love to get more involved in LA, as we will stay for a few years at least.\n\nMy recent talks were on \"Welcoming Communities\" [1] at EmpireJS and Cascadia.js. I was part of the community panel at last year’s GitHub universe [2]. I talked on small modules (semantic-release & Greenkeeper) at Boston.js, and noBackend at Front-Trends [3]. I gave my first talk on Offline First at Brazil JS in 2014.\n\nI’m one of the founding contributors to Hoodie (hood.ie) – an Open Source Backend for web applications. It stores data on the client by default and syncs whenever the connectivity allows, hence we started offlinefirst.org back in 2013. I co-organized the first \"Offline Camps\" [4] last year, I’ll be on a panel at SXSW and we will host a track at a conference toward the end of this year.\n",

I'd like to showcase this module along with the options available to us today when it comes to creating music with JavaScript in the browser and Node.js right from the terminal. Using my module and regular JavaScript String and Array functions I will put together the basic structure of an Electronic Dance Music track and show how easy it is for you to start dabbling with EDM using JavaScript.\n\nRequirements\n\nSince this talk is primarily around dance music with JS, a good sound is required (If the venue is not too big, I can get my own sound)\nI will be live coding - I will compose parts of a EDM track with JavaScript and Node.js\n\nPast talks where I presented this topic with variations:\n* JS @ PayPal\n* SF Node @ GitHub HQ\n* ForwardJS\n\nIf you d like to get an idea of the kind of talk it would be, you can take a look at this publicly available video of my talk at Github https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIiwFzFvsmw\n\nI hope you ll consider my talk worthy of your meetup. Nat Lubeck is the one who told me about this wonderful meetup when I moved to LA earlier this year. Looking forward to speaking at JS.la,\n\nSincerely!",

We've found the concepts translate well across of a variety of client projects, platforms, and frameworks, so much so that it's almost our de facto standard way to build frontends.\n\nWe also work on React projects that use Redux. Often the Redux code becomes a pain point that slows down the rest of the project. We've begun exploring using ReactiveX's javascript library, RxJS, as an alternative to Redux, and we'd like to share what we've learned.\n\nThis talk will provide:\n\n1. A general introduction to functional reactive programming.\n2. An introduction to ReactiveX libraries\n3. A broad comparison between ReactiveX and Redux\n",

Even though that was only one page, it was a checkout page, so there were a lot of things going on there: a lot of API calls to verify the data, need to decrypt the params that were passed there, additionally would need to encrypt the response as well. \nFirst thought was - to build an server app that would return simple HTML/CSS and may have some vanila JS. But that looks too much for hosting one page, and I was really worry about scaling of it, we expected a huge peaks of load. And the final decision was to have AWS lambda render a page for us. \nSo the talk would be about SSR of React app in cloud functions (particularly aws lambda).",
