It can be difficult to write and deploy applications this way, but I've written some libraries such as dnode, upnode, seaport, and fleet to make this much easier to manage. In this talk I'll show how you can glue tiny processes together and split bigger ones up with these tools.",

With WebGL it was different - my first contact with this technology was through a client project. I had to learn WebGL on the go. It took me a few months to actually start apperciating it, but once the project was over and I thought I know everything about it, I decided to write my own engine that I baptized simply J3D. After a good start, I realized I didn't know that much about WebGL after all... Since then I spent many day & nights (mostly nights) learning and creating what I believe is a good tool for other developers to start creating 3D applications in the browser. In my presentation I talk about specific challenges when working WebGL projects and how J3D addresses them. I will also take you on a short walk-through of it's features and present some demos.",

AngularJS is a client-side JavaScript web development framework where we believe we’ve done something special. We’ve approached the problem let’s say differently from the way any other JavaScript tool has before. Instead of asking what kind of functions we could provide to make writing apps smoother, we asked \"what if the browser worked differently in a way that eliminates code and gives structure to apps?\" This talk will take the audience on a tour of what the web platform of the future will look like and how the AngularJS framework can provide many of the powerful capabilities to existing browsers and bridge the path to web components, model driven views and other platform features that are currently being spec-ed.",

It also needs to be thoughtfully crafted to work on phones and tablets all the while having the level of animation and polish users have come to expect from the technology they use regardless of platform. Static pages with responsive layouts aren't going to cut it in this new universe, so we'll look at using only JavaScript to structure applications, create and style markup, and also be platform aware in order to present users with an interactive experience suited for each device. This talk will be a general theory overview accompanied by plenty of examples and very brief code demonstrations. It will cover interesting points along the way such as best practices for smooth UI and animation, content management, SEO, and even how to use these exact techniques to create native mobile applications.",

Jukebox.js is an open source experiment showing what you can do with some of the latest web technologies like file access, audio playback, chat, and real time collaboration. The web app is built with tools including backbone.js, socket.io, aurora.js, dancer.js, and more.  The server is built on house.js, a node.js open source platform as a service to provide RESTful interfaces to authentication, file systems, data and media.

I love the Open Source community in general, and the JavaScript community in general, and have been involved in the communities we lived before in Boston, Zurich and Berlin. I would love to get more involved in LA, as we will stay for a few years at least.\n\nMy recent talks were on \"Welcoming Communities\" [1] at EmpireJS and Cascadia.js. I was part of the community panel at last year’s GitHub universe [2]. I talked on small modules (semantic-release & Greenkeeper) at Boston.js, and noBackend at Front-Trends [3]. I gave my first talk on Offline First at Brazil JS in 2014.\n\nI’m one of the founding contributors to Hoodie (hood.ie) – an Open Source Backend for web applications. It stores data on the client by default and syncs whenever the connectivity allows, hence we started offlinefirst.org back in 2013. I co-organized the first \"Offline Camps\" [4] last year, I’ll be on a panel at SXSW and we will host a track at a conference toward the end of this year.\n",

While we have good and proven solutions it's not uncommon to still see these vulnerabilities in modern and legacy applications in use today. Typically this is due to the solutions not being utilized by the engineers, the application's framework not having support, or the engineers subverting the functionality to work around issues in the application. We'll take a deep dive into just how CSRF works followed by why the vulnerability class exists, and finally end demonstrating a solution that can be injected into any JavaScript frontend application to add support to existing applications.",

I'd like to showcase this module along with the options available to us today when it comes to creating music with JavaScript in the browser and Node.js right from the terminal. Using my module and regular JavaScript String and Array functions I will put together the basic structure of an Electronic Dance Music track and show how easy it is for you to start dabbling with EDM using JavaScript.\n\nRequirements\n\nSince this talk is primarily around dance music with JS, a good sound is required (If the venue is not too big, I can get my own sound)\nI will be live coding - I will compose parts of a EDM track with JavaScript and Node.js\n\nPast talks where I presented this topic with variations:\n* JS @ PayPal\n* SF Node @ GitHub HQ\n* ForwardJS\n\nIf you d like to get an idea of the kind of talk it would be, you can take a look at this publicly available video of my talk at Github https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIiwFzFvsmw\n\nI hope you ll consider my talk worthy of your meetup. Nat Lubeck is the one who told me about this wonderful meetup when I moved to LA earlier this year. Looking forward to speaking at JS.la,\n\nSincerely!",

Often the Redux code becomes a pain point that slows down the rest of the project. We've begun exploring using ReactiveX's javascript library, RxJS, as an alternative to Redux, and we'd like to share what we've learned.\n\nThis talk will provide:\n\n1.

But that looks too much for hosting one page, and I was really worry about scaling of it, we expected a huge peaks of load. And the final decision was to have AWS lambda render a page for us. \nSo the talk would be about SSR of React app in cloud functions (particularly aws lambda).",

          "abstract": "A year ago I was tasked to test typical Microservices-based project with modern frontend and the traditional tools just didn't work for me. So I went into a journey of finding modern techniques that might score better and guess what: I discovered a handful of neat techniques that rocked my testing world. Let's discuss when the traditional testing tools fall short and how modern and emerging techniques can sometimes do better: In the past 10 years, the dev world had gone through dramatic changes but the testing models were left intact leaving us wondering how to test things like Microservice, and Serverless. This session demonstrates the new wave of testing tools (e.g. property-based testing, consumer-driven contract, fuzz, and others) and how they can better fit modern applications. This session aims to inspire with modern testing ideas, but it also packs practical and down-to-earth code demos. \n\nAbout me - Yoni Goldberg: I'm an independent consultant who works with 500 fortune corporates and garage startups on polishing their JS & Node.js applications.

The point of testing (it's actually to speed up releases, not necessarily catching bugs!)\n2. The low hanging fruit big wins you can make at work tomorrow (it's not trying to convince business to give you 4 weeks to write write brittle end to end tests and not push out features).\n3.

          "abstract": "TypeScript and GraphQL are each popular topics in the front-end JS community right now, but over the past year of working with this stack I've come to believe the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. \n\nGraphQL is known for its flexibility (query the fields you want), its graph structure (query related objects), and for its strong typing. But what happens when you receive all that strongly-typed data in a JS application? This talk will examine typical practices and patterns around data-fetching in the absence of GQL or TS (`lodash.get` anyone?), then explore the benefits of end-to-end typing when you add TypeScript in: certainty, reliability, and self-documentation among them. \n\nUnfortunately, those benefits don't come for free. I'll recount some of the challenges my teams have faced as we adopted this stack, and our strategies to address them:\n\n    * We began with a team experienced in TypeScript, which led to some complicated typing. But advanced TypeScript has a serious learning curve, so onboarding new members proved difficult.\n    * \"Error\" handling: GraphQL's built-in error handling is _not typed_. So representing cases other than the happy path while maintaining type-safety requires implementing those cases as regular schema types, not as exceptions. \n    * Manually typing all GraphQL responses is burdensome and error-prone, which is exactly what we've been trying to avoid. Tools exist to _generate_ types from your GraphQL schema and operations, but they're still fast-moving and imperfect; we continue to struggle with them. \n\nI'll conclude by answering and asking a few questions:\n    * Given all these challenges, was it worth it? \n    * Is this where front-end development is going? \n    * Is this still the JavaScript we know and love, or just Java?",

Unfortunately, your deadlines are due yesterday, your boss is unconvinced, and your team remains skeptical. What's a TypeScript enthusiast to do? Join me on a journey of self-discovery: we'll learn what it means to lead by influence and level up our effectiveness as engineers. Then, an exploration of the value to engineering and business brought about by type systems (with some math to prove it). To tie it all together, we'll explore this through the lens of real world stories from Netflix, where we use TypeScript to modernize filmmaking.",
