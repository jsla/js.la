In this talk, we'll explore the basics of functional programming - higher-order functions, lazy evaluation and immutable persistent data structures. We'll see how a functional style helps you compose logic in a way that's clean, testable and free of certain classes of bugs. Then we'll tie it together into a purely functional style by demonstrating a clever algorithmic game solver.",
