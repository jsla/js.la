# Code of Conduct

[JS.LA](http://js.la) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of js.la participants in any
form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any js.la venue,
including talks.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the js.la organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
expulsion from js.la. If you are being harassed, notice that someone
else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member
of js.la staff immediately.

Js.la staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of js.la.

We value your attendance.

<3 carlo, david, jason, and mike
